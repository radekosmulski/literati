# literati


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

Jupyter notebook combines prose with code in a notebook. `literati`
combines prose with code in a markdown file.

## Usage

Run `literati`. Create a `<file_name>.md` with your favorite editor.

Write code interwoven with markdown:

    ```python
    def hello():
        print("Hello, World!")
    ```

Whenever you save your file, `literati` transcribes your file to
`py/<file_name>.py` stripping all the markdown. Only the code remains.

Run `python py/<file_name>.py` to run your code.

### Options

- `literati --path /custom/path` - Monitor a different directory
- `literati --output-dir custom_output` - Use a different output
  directory

## The Why

I wanted to try the following pattern of working with LLMs:

- context is your code
- when you want to make changes or additions, provide the context to
  your LLM
- ask for modifications
- update the context to reflect the new information

Context and code, always in sync. For you and your LLM.
